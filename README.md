# Context
This is a Frontend project.

On this project my goal is to create an application capable of playing music from a wide range of artists and bands, creating a list of favorite songs and editing the profile of the logged-in user. This application will be able to:

- Login.
- Search for a band or artist.
- List the available albums of this band or artist.
- View songs from a selected album.
- Play a preview of the songs on the album.
- Favorite and unfavorite songs.
- View the list of favorite songs.
- View the profile of the logged in person.
- Edit the profile of the logged in person.
